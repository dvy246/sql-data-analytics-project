/*****************************************************************************
 * Part-to-Whole Analysis SQL Scripts
 *
 * Overview:
 *   This script provides SQL queries to analyze how individual parts (such as products, categories, or organizational units) contribute to the overall total within a business context. 
 *   By breaking down key metrics into constituent components, these analyses help quantify each partâ€™s share of the whole and track how these proportions evolve over time.
 *
 * Key Features:
 *   - Calculates each item's percentage contribution to the total for a specified metric (e.g., sales, revenue, units sold).
 *   - Supports analysis by category, product, or other dimensional attributes.
 *   - Enables part-to-whole comparisons over time (monthly, yearly, etc.).
 *   - Useful for understanding concentration, distribution, and identifying top contributors.
 *
 * Use Cases:
 *   - Determining what share of overall sales each product category or region represents.
 *   - Identifying the most or least significant contributors to business performance.
 *   - Supporting Pareto (80/20) analysis for resource allocation or strategy planning.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Modify table and column names as appropriate for your data warehouse schema.
 *   - Can be extended to include additional dimensions, cumulative sums, or running totals if needed.
